# Workflows

## Roof Water Damage

This workflow outlines the steps to handle roof water damage in an HOA community, including responsible parties, available options, and associated risks for each decision point.

---

### Step 1: Incident Reporting and Documentation

**Owner:** Homeowner or Property Manager

**Actions:**
- Document the damage (photos, videos, written description)
- Note date, time, and extent of damage
- Identify affected units/areas

**Options:**

- **Homeowner reports directly to Board**
  - *Risk:* Delayed response if Board members are unavailable; potential miscommunication

- **Homeowner reports to Management Company**
  - *Risk:* Additional communication layer may slow response; dependency on management company availability

**Recommended:** Report through established communication channels (typically Management Company during business hours, emergency contact after hours)

---

### Step 2: Emergency Mitigation

**Owner:** HOA Board (via Management Company or emergency vendor)

**Actions:**
- Stop active water intrusion (tarps, temporary repairs)
- Prevent further damage (water extraction, fans, dehumidifiers)
- Secure the area if necessary

**Options:**

- **Use pre-approved emergency vendor**
  - *Risk:* May be more expensive; vendor may not be immediately available
  - *Benefit:* Established relationship, known quality

- **Source new emergency vendor**
  - *Risk:* Unknown quality and reliability; potential delays in vetting
  - *Benefit:* May find better pricing; availability when preferred vendor is busy

- **Delay mitigation to get multiple bids**
  - *Risk:* Significant additional damage; mold growth; increased total costs; potential liability for negligence

**Recommended:** Immediate action using pre-approved vendor or first available qualified contractor

---

### Step 3: Damage Assessment

**Owner:** HOA Board (typically delegates to Management Company)

**Actions:**
- Inspect roof and affected areas
- Determine cause (age, storm, defect, maintenance failure)
- Estimate repair costs
- Assess if this is common area or unit owner responsibility

**Options:**

- **Management Company conducts assessment**
  - *Risk:* May lack technical expertise for complex issues; potential conflict of interest with preferred vendors

- **Hire independent roofing contractor for assessment**
  - *Risk:* Additional cost; contractor may bid higher to secure work
  - *Benefit:* Expert technical opinion; detailed scope of work

- **Hire third-party inspector/engineer**
  - *Risk:* Highest cost for assessment; may be unnecessary for simple issues
  - *Benefit:* Unbiased assessment; professional documentation useful for insurance or litigation

**Recommended:** Use qualified roofing contractor for assessment; consider engineer for major damage or disputes

---

### Step 4: Responsibility Determination

**Owner:** HOA Board (with legal counsel if disputed)

**Actions:**
- Review governing documents (CC&Rs, bylaws)
- Determine if damage is to common area or unit
- Assess if negligence or maintenance failure is involved

**Options:**

- **HOA assumes full responsibility**
  - *Risk:* May set precedent; costs borne by all homeowners
  - *Applies when:* Clear common area damage; HOA maintenance failure

- **Homeowner assumes full responsibility**
  - *Risk:* Homeowner may dispute; potential litigation; relationship damage
  - *Applies when:* Unit-specific issue; homeowner negligence or lack of maintenance

- **Shared responsibility**
  - *Risk:* Complex to administer; potential disputes over percentage
  - *Applies when:* Both common area and unit elements involved

- **Pursue third-party liability** (e.g., roofer, developer)
  - *Risk:* Lengthy process; legal costs; uncertain outcome
  - *Benefit:* May recover costs if defect or negligence by third party

**Recommended:** Clear documentation and legal review for disputed cases

---

### Step 5: Financing Decision

**Owner:** HOA Board

**Actions:**
- Review repair cost estimates
- Assess HOA financial position
- Determine funding method

**Options:**

- **Pay from operating account**
  - *Risk:* Cash flow deficit; may impact routine operations and maintenance; insufficient funds for other emergencies
  - *Benefit:* No insurance premium increase; immediate funds available; no deductible
  - *Best for:* Minor repairs under $5,000-$10,000

- **Pay from reserve account**
  - *Risk:* Depletes reserves intended for planned major repairs; may require special assessment later for planned projects
  - *Benefit:* Designed for this purpose; no insurance impact; no deductible
  - *Best for:* Moderate to major repairs; roof-related issues if reserves are adequately funded

- **File insurance claim**
  - *Risk:* Premium increase (10-25% typical); potential for non-renewal; deductible cost ($2,500-$25,000 common); claim on loss history
  - *Benefit:* Large losses covered; preserves HOA cash and reserves
  - *Best for:* Major damage exceeding $25,000-$50,000 or when reserves/operating funds insufficient

- **Special assessment to homeowners**
  - *Risk:* Homeowner dissatisfaction; collection challenges; hardship for some owners; potential impact on property values
  - *Benefit:* Immediate funding; no debt service; shares cost burden fairly
  - *Best for:* Large unexpected expenses when reserves and insurance are not viable options

- **Obtain loan or line of credit**
  - *Risk:* Interest costs; debt service impacts cash flow; may require homeowner vote; qualification requirements
  - *Benefit:* Spreads costs over time; preserves reserves; avoids insurance claim
  - *Best for:* Large repairs when special assessment would cause hardship

**Decision Matrix:**

| Repair Cost | Operating/Reserve Adequate? | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| < $10,000 | Yes | Operating account |
| $10,000 - $50,000 | Yes | Reserve account |
| $10,000 - $50,000 | No | Consider loan or small special assessment |
| > $50,000 | Yes | Reserve account or insurance claim (analyze premium impact) |
| > $50,000 | No | Insurance claim, loan, or special assessment |

### Step 6: Obtain Bids and Select Contractor

**Owner:** HOA Board (typically via Management Company)

**Actions:**
- Solicit competitive bids (typically 3 minimum)
- Review contractor qualifications, insurance, references
- Compare scope, timeline, and pricing

**Options:**

- **Accept lowest bid**
  - *Risk:* Lower quality work; contractor may cut corners; potential change orders; warranty issues

- **Accept middle or higher bid with better qualifications**
  - *Risk:* Higher immediate cost
  - *Benefit:* Better quality, warranty, and contractor reputation; fewer issues

- **Negotiate with preferred contractor**
  - *Risk:* May not achieve best pricing
  - *Benefit:* Relationship and known quality

- **Re-bid if all bids too high**
  - *Risk:* Delays; damage may worsen; seasonal pricing may increase
  - *Benefit:* Potentially better pricing; more contractor options

**Recommended:** Select based on value (qualifications + price), not lowest price alone

---

### Step 7: Homeowner Communication

**Owner:** HOA Board (via Management Company)

**Actions:**
- Notify affected homeowners of timeline
- Explain access requirements
- Provide regular updates

**Options:**

- **Minimal communication** (only as legally required)
  - *Risk:* Homeowner dissatisfaction; complaints; lack of cooperation; potential board challenges

- **Proactive, detailed communication**
  - *Risk:* Time investment; managing expectations
  - *Benefit:* Homeowner satisfaction; cooperation; transparency

**Recommended:** Proactive communication to maintain trust and cooperation

---

### Step 8: Repair Execution and Monitoring

**Owner:** Management Company (oversight) and Contractor (execution)

**Actions:**
- Contractor performs repairs per scope
- Management Company or Board representative monitors progress
- Address any change orders or complications

**Options:**

- **Minimal oversight**
  - *Risk:* Work quality issues; scope creep; unauthorized changes; payment disputes

- **Active project management**
  - *Risk:* Time investment; potential for micromanagement
  - *Benefit:* Quality assurance; timely issue resolution; change order control

**Recommended:** Regular site visits and photo documentation

---

### Step 9: Final Inspection and Payment

**Owner:** HOA Board (via Management Company)

**Actions:**
- Inspect completed work
- Obtain warranties and documentation
- Process final payment (often hold retention until final acceptance)

**Options:**

- **Pay immediately upon completion**
  - *Risk:* Reduced leverage if defects discovered later

- **Retain 10% pending final inspection**
  - *Risk:* Contractor may delay warranty or punch-list items
  - *Benefit:* Ensures completion of all work and correction of defects

- **Require extended warranty**
  - *Risk:* Additional cost; contractor may charge premium
  - *Benefit:* Long-term protection; peace of mind

**Recommended:** Retain percentage pending satisfactory inspection; obtain warranties in writing

---

### Step 10: Documentation and Follow-Up

**Owner:** Management Company (with Board oversight)

**Actions:**
- File all invoices, receipts, and warranties
- Update reserve study if applicable
- Document lessons learned
- Schedule follow-up inspection (30, 60, 90 days)

**Options:**

- **Minimal documentation**
  - *Risk:* Difficulty with warranty claims; audit issues; lost institutional knowledge; repeat mistakes

- **Comprehensive documentation**
  - *Risk:* Time investment
  - *Benefit:* Facilitates warranty claims; audit trail; knowledge transfer; continuous improvement

**Recommended:** Maintain detailed project file with timeline, decisions, and outcomes

---

### Step 11: Insurance Claim Process (If Applicable)

**Owner:** HOA Board (via Management Company and Insurance Agent/Broker)

**Actions:**
- File claim promptly (typically within 30-60 days)
- Provide documentation (photos, estimates, invoices)
- Cooperate with adjuster inspection
- Negotiate settlement if initial offer inadequate

**Options:**

- **Accept initial insurance offer**
  - *Risk:* May be lower than actual costs; leaves HOA underfunded

- **Negotiate or appeal**
  - *Risk:* Time delay; potential claim denial; adjuster relationship
  - *Benefit:* May receive fair compensation

- **Hire public adjuster**
  - *Risk:* Cost (typically 10-20% of settlement); may strain relationship with insurance company
  - *Benefit:* Professional expertise; typically higher settlements; handles complexity

**Recommended:** Review initial offer carefully; negotiate if inadequate; consider public adjuster for complex or large claims
