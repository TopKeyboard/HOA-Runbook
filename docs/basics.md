# HOA Basics

## Stakeholders

### Homeowner
A property owner within the community who is automatically a member of the association with voting rights and the responsibility to pay dues and follow community rules.

### Homeowner Association (HOA)
The legal entity composed of all homeowners that owns common areas, enforces rules, and is governed by CC&Rs, articles of incorporation, and bylaws.

### HOA Board
A group of homeowners elected by the membership to manage the association, make decisions, set budgets, and hire service providers on behalf of all homeowners.

### HOA Management Company
An optional third-party service provider hired by the Board to handle day-to-day operations like collecting dues, maintaining records, and coordinating repairs.

Homeowners elect the Board, which hires and oversees the Management Company—ultimate authority rests with the homeowners.

## Decision Making Process

### Board Decisions
The HOA Board makes most day-to-day decisions including vendor selection, rule enforcement, budget management, and policy creation—decisions can typically be made by majority vote at board meetings.

### Homeowner Approval Required
Major decisions require a vote of the full membership, including amendments to governing documents, special assessments beyond board authority limits, and significant changes to common areas—voting thresholds are defined in the bylaws (commonly 50-75% of members).

### Management Company Role
The Management Company executes decisions made by the Board but does not have decision-making authority—they provide recommendations and implement approved policies.

### Emergency Decisions
Board members (often the President) may make emergency decisions to protect the association from immediate harm, with full board ratification required at the next meeting.
